### UniversalFermenter
This mod is a framework that allows making any building a fermenting or processing building. It allows producing an output product from an input product over time with various factors affecting the speed and success of that process. The normal use-case for this framework are fermenting processes like beer from wort in vanilla. But it can also be used for very different processes.
